# QT-Proto
A handy-dandy little prototyping board for the Adafruit QT Py line and Seeed Xiao module.

## Prototyping on the Adafruit QT Py and Seeed Xiao
Adafruit's [QT Py](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325) line of development boards and Seeed Studio's [Xiao module]( https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) are two miniature development platforms useful for prototyping projects that need to pack a lot of microcontroller goodness into a tiny amount of space.

The diminutive size of these boards makes them great for a range of IoT, wearable, embedded, or other projects requiring that everything be kept as compact as possible. However, it can also be a bit tricky to prototype with these modules since it is hard to wire external components onto these densely packed boards.
Enter the **QT Proto** board. This board will make your QT Py and Xiao prototyping efforts much easier by providing a breadboard-like grid of plated holes to which wires can be directly soldered, 2.54mm pitched components can be directly plugged in, or headers can be directly added. Depending upon the needs of your project, the QT Proto can be soldered either on top of the host module or underneath it. If you are a bit careful with your wiring, the QT Proto can also be added on top of other QT Py or Xiao expansion boards.
